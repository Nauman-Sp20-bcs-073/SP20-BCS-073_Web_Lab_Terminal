Web lab terminal exam

I have combined both Q1 and Q2, I made bother server side rendering in EJS where you can login, register, ADD todos.

You can only add todos from server side app

You can delete todos from client side (REACT)

Login and registeration works on EJS (Server side, where it will return back a token when logged in)

1st you will see the ejs app and inside it there will bea folder by the name of ClientSideAppReact which contains client side rendering
